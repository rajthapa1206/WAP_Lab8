7 ans: Free variable in context of add() is counter since it is declared outside the function and is also not passed as a parameter but used within.
var add = (function(){
	var counter = 0;
	return function (){
		return counter += 1;
	}
})();
Here counter is declared outside the function and also not passed as a parameter but the value of counter is incremented inside the function closure.
9 ans:
	We need to create a namespace inside the global namespace and transfer all variables and functions inside the created namespace
	which will remove them from the global namespace. eg:
	var a = 3;
	var b = 5;
	function multiply(a,b) {
    return a * b;
	}
	These are in global namespace which can be removed from global by creating a namespace.
	var app  = {
		a : 3,
		b : 5,
		multiply: function(a, b) {
			return a * b;
		}
	}
	The variables a, b and function multiply are removed from global namespace and transfered to app namespace.
